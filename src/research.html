                            <p class="description text-justify mb-4"> We present an analytical method for studying the role of the micropatterned morphology of soft fingers with wet adhesion
                            in grasping a deformable thin shell. This letter originated from a project on a robotic platform for autonomous
                            attachment and removal of a soft contact lens in a “human eye” under a wet environment. In this scenario, a contact lens
                            (hemispherical thin shell) was gripped by a soft-fingered hand in three conditions: inside/outside a liquid environment
                            and when the contact lens was in contact with a convex curved substrate (as an eye). Two fingertip surfaces were
                            compared: a flat surface, and a micropatterned surface inspired by the adhesion mechanism of a tree-frog's toes. The
                            pattern of the latter comprised 3600 square cells, each of size 85 μm × 85 μm interspaced by 15 μm. A proposed
                            analytical model was utilized to evaluate the grasp forces in both types of fingertip surface. The forces were
                            subsequently verified by application in grasping a contact lens. The experimental results showed good agreement with the
                            analysis as the micropattern pad decreased the preload and deformation of the shell 1.1-2× lower than that of the flat
                            surface. This letter could be extended to model grasping interfaces with deformable curvature objects in wet and high
                            moisture content environments.</p>

                            <p class="description text-justify mb-4"> The sense of touch allows individuals to physicallyinteract with and better perceive their environment. Touch is
                            evenmore crucial for robots, as robots equipped with thorough tactilesensation can more safely interact with their
                            surroundings, includ-ing with humans. This study describes a recently developed large-scale tactile sensing system for a
                            robotic link, called TacLINK,which can be assembled to form a whole-body tactile sensing robotarm. The proposed system
                            is an elongated structure consistingof a rigid transparent bone covered by continuous artificial softskin. This soft
                            skin of TacLINK not only provides a pleasantinteractive interface but can also change outer skin morphologyby inflation
                            at low pressure. Upon contact with the surroundingenvironment, TacLINK perceives tactile information through the3-D
                            deformation of its skin, resulting from the tracking of anarray of markers on its inner wall by a stereo camera located
                            atboth ends of the transparent bone. A finite element model wasformulated to describe the relationship between applied
                            force andthe displacements of markers, allowing detailed tactile informa-tion, such as contact location and force
                            distribution, to be derivedsimultaneously, regardless of the number of contacts. TacLINKis scalable in size, durable in
                            operation, and low in cost, as wellas being a high performance system, characteristics that can beexploited in the
                            design of interactive robotic arms, prostheticarms, and service robots. This study describes the design of theTacLINK,
                            as well as its modeling, implementation and evaluation,with the results suggesting that similar tactile sensing systems
                            canbe widely applied in robot</p>

                            midline, which describes the path of the spine, is frequently studied to represent the whole body for the purpose of
                            simplifying analysis. We investigated midline kinematics in a model angulliform swimmer. Typical kinematic parameters of
                            the robot body during swimming were estimated to examine their change with variation of frequency. A kinematic model of
                            the robot body was built to estimate the thrust force component. The results revealed good potential to develop our
                            proposed design with midline robot body kinematic properties similar to those in natural long body fish, with movement
                            in the robot body able to create thrust force.</p>

                            <p class="description text-justify mb-4"> We proposed an active tactile sensing system that selects sensing modalities based on specific sensing tasks, by
                            changing its morphology, called <span class="font-bold">Wrin'Tac </span> . This work was inspired by the human finger wet-induced wrinkle, which is
                            usually observed when one soaks in warm water for a period, and has been indicated as an efficient transformation for
                            enhancement of gripping stability in a wet environment. We proposed a device which is an integration of actuation
                            (pneumatic actuator) and sensing elements (strain gauges) inside a thin, multi-layered substrate. Under pressurization,
                            the morphology of the substrate surface (both geometrical and mechanical characteristics) change with appearance of
                            wrinkles. Especially, by formation of wrinkles, this device can change its shape so that the posture of embedded sensing
                            elements (strain gauges) can vary and generate different responses depending on external load conditions. As a result,
                            this device can actively select its sensing functions depending on specific sensing tasks. First, we created a model to
                            investigate the dynamic changes in a strain gauges' mechanical response under formation of wrinkles. Then, a prototype
                            of this sensing device and its fabrication process were proposed to accomplish sensing tasks under vertical indentation
                            and horizontal sliding action on its surface by using one type of strain gauge. This work is an example of soft
                            morphological control in tactile sensing, and is expected to open a new avenue to development of tactile sensing
                            systems. This is also an implementation in a broader idea on <span class="font-bold"> VANmorph</span>, Variable Afferent Network morphology.</p>

                            <p class="description text-justify mb-4"> THuman-in-the-loop task involving soft contact has become common in robotic application, especially in physical
                            human-robot interaction. In this task, it is required that robot would sense interactions of human by touching or
                            sliding, as well as assess possibility of touch pattern when human is approaching by proximity sensation. In addition,
                            it is also essential to fabricate an interface so that human does not feel uncomfortable during long-run physical
                            interaction with robot. We attempt to fabricate a soft interface (or a robotic skin system) completely constructed from
                            fabrics and soft materials that can sense both proximity and applied force from human's touch, and especially the
                            sliding event on its surface. The skin consists of a matrix of sensing elements that is able to cover any curvature in a
                            robot body. Each sensing element can sense the relative distance of conductive object (or human body) that is
                            approaching the sensing element's surface, 2x2 contact force distribution when the object makes contact with the sensing
                            element, and onset of slippage . By exploiting simultaneous measurement of capacitance, each fabric sensing element can
                            smoothly switch the proximity mode and tactile mode based on position of the object. We also constructed a model that
                            can predict variation of capacitance measurement of proximity and tactile modes during operation for further analysis.
                            The methods and results presented in this paper can be extended to construct a larger scale of robotic skin for robot's
                            body, and act as a platform for study human-robot interaction.</p>

                            The hand is made of a non-stretchable thin film, the two ends of which are attached to a soft substrate, forming an
                            enclosed wrinkled shape. When the substrate is elongated, the morphology of the hand changes varied, resulting in a
                            “wrapping” form around the grasped object. This design is applicable to a wide range of objects that can be grasped by
                            the robotic hand. The smallest and biggest sizes of the grasped object are determined by the morphological computation
                            of the film during design of the hand. This design also reduces the uncertainty of position between the hand and the
                            object; i.e., stable grasping can be maintained as long as the object fits within the enclosed form of the hand. A
                            mechanism controlling the morphology of the film using only one actuator, and for grasping food products such as fruits,
                            is proposed. Preliminary results show the potential of the hand's morphology in the design of soft robotic mechanisms.</p>

                            <p class="description text-justify mb-4"> We proposed a novel approach to the fabrication of a soft robotic gripper/hand with contact feedback for grasping
                            delicate objects. Each finger has a multilayered structure, consisting of a main structure and sensing elements. The
                            main structure includes a softer layer much thicker than a stiffer layer. The gripping energy of the fingers is
                            generated from the elastic energy of the pre-stretched softer layers, and controlled by simple tendon strings
                            pulled/released by a single actuation. Due to the pre-stretching and the difference in moduli among layers, the
                            shape/posture of the fingers in stable state is similar to that of soft fingers actuated by pressurization. Then, we
                            were able to design a soft-fingered hand for different applications by changing the morphological shape of layers. In
                            addition, the hand includes a soft, flexible, and stretchable sensing element for the detection of contact and applied
                            force, which can also be used in other designs of soft fingers. We assessed the ability of the proposed soft hand to
                            grasp food products with feedback of contact location. The experimental results showed that the proposed hand could
                            safely grasp light and delicate objects, such as fruits, and that it could possibly distinguish among objects based on
                            feedback from sensors. The design proposed in this paper may give rise to other soft hand designs, along with the
                            possibility of using morphological imbalanced deformation of multilayered structures in soft robotics research.</p>

                        tele-operation and robotic surgery. Soft contact in this task may include a soft-fingered robot hand gripping a rock, or
                        robotic control of forceps to pick up a tissue sample. In these scenarios, operators normally struggle with controlling
                        the gripping force of the remote robotic hand, so that the grasped object is neither dropped nor damaged. Information
                        about slippage, especially incipient slippage (or pre-slide), occurring at the contact surface is not properly sensed by
                        the operator through cutaneous tactile feedback. This study aimed to generate pre-slide sensation on human fingertip for
                        enhancement of slip perception of soft objects. We hypothesized that use of a method that can reproduce localized
                        slippage can enhance human perception of slippage based on our previous study of soft-based contact. We created a
                        grounded slip haptic display device, which can efficiently assess partial slippage on a human fingertip efficiently
                        using a bundle of pins under only one actuation. This paper focuses on the creation of the device, including its
                        theoretical underpinnings and design process, as well as assessing its efficiency in enhancing skin stretching through
                        static and dynamic simulations. The device can be utilized to assess the slide process of a human fingertip, perceiving
